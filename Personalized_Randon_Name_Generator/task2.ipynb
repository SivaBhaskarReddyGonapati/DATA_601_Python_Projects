    "For this task I am considering Fillipino culture naming convention(Philippines country).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The history of Spanish and American colonisation in the Philippines has led Filipino naming conventions \n",
    "to be heavily influenced by both Spanish and Western practices. Filipino names follow the Spanish tradition\n",
    "of using both paternal and maternal surnames, while structuring names according to the Western name order of \n",
    "first name, middle name and surname.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fillipino culture Generally name consists of three parts first_name, middle_name, last_name same as western style but as fillipino naming convention  is mix of both spanish and western naming convention what goes in middle_name and last_name is according to spanish tradion.\n",
    "\n",
    "--> The first_name is identifier name or personal name given to boy or girl at birth<br>\n",
    "--> The middle_name is the Mother's family name<br>\n",
    "--> The last_name is the Father's family name<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Full Name = First Name +  Mother's Family Name +  Father's Family Name <b>\n",
    "\n",
    "By using both Mother's and Father's family names in their names people will be equally attached to both side families.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>References :<b>\n",
